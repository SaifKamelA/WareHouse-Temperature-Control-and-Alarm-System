- Before you run the program make sure that you have your emulator and connector between thhe advancedHMI and emulator in order for the project to run.
- if you can't do that or don't have time for it. there is a mp4 that you can check.
- if the program didn't work duo to any kind of misscommunication between your emulator and vs. give the project a try in rslogix it self and the emulator to be easier for you to see the program running without all this complicated stuff.

Thank you.
